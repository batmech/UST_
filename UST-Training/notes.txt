Shallow and Deep Copy 
Shallow Copy: Stores the references of object ie, changes made are reflected back
Deep Copy: Stores the copy of the values of object

global functions:
global() [var] = value (This is done inside a functions have same var name)
It's a dictionary

Nesting Rules:
LEGB (Local, Enclosing, Global, Built-In)


Constructor is called 'magic method' because it is called 
implicitly. (not just the Constructor)

We can make a method inside a class static by not passing the 
self argument.

Access modifier in Python: public, private, strongly private
Essentially adding '_' to the variable names.
private would have one '_', strongly private will have 2 of em.
To change strongly private value, objectName._ClassName__var (mangaling process)

Magic methods of a Class: dir(className)
__new__ is a magic method, useful in dealing with APIs
__new__ is called before __init__

Context Manager:
Alloactes and release resources when you want to.
Eg: as, with (used in files, exception handling etc)
Magic methods such as __enter__ and __exit__ are used
