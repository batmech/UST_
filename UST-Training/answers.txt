FlowChart, Algorithm, Pseudo Code of Factorial of Number

Algorithm:
1. Start
2. Enter input from user into num
3. Check if num is less 0:
    3.1 Print 'Not defined for negative nunbers'
4. Set fact as 1
5. Loop i from 2 to num:
	5.1 Multiply fact with i
6. Print fact

Pseudo Code:
Step 1: Declare N and F as integer variable.
Step 2: Initialize F=1.
Step 2: Enter the value of N.
Step 3: Check whether N>0, if not then F=1.
Step 4: If yes then, F=F*N
Step 5: Decrease the value of N by 1 .
Step 6: Repeat step 4 and 5 until N=0.
Step 7: Now print the value of F.
